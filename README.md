# Weather Forecast Website

### Please note that this is a legacy project.

It is my first project in which I used JavaScript in practice.

The project is a simple weather app.

The app displays today's weather and time in a searched city as well as weather for upcoming 3 days :)

You can check the weather all around the world

Technologies used:

- HTML, CSS, JS
- Webpack

Fun fact: The background changes based on the time of the day in desired location.

Feel free to test it here: https://mecies.github.io/weather-app/
